                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>Goal is to capture as many ghosts üëª as possible in the smallest confined area.
                    The game works from right to left. That means your ending box should be the top left corner.
                    If you draw a line and a ghost is on the right side, well... you should say goodbye
                    to that ghost ‚òπÔ∏è. Remember all ghosts move at different speed and have different sizes.
                    Make sure you account for that. If you shoot a laser when a ghost was directly on the laser,
                    they will wiggle uncontrollably because they are being consistently hit by the laser! Don't torture
                    the ghosts! They have feelings too!
                </p>

            <div id='rules'>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrow keys and "WASD" control the arrows in the bottom right corner</li>
                    <li>To shoot a laser beam you can use 'Z' or 'K' for a vertical laser
                        and 'X' and 'L' to shoot lasers horizontally
                    </li>
                    <li>You should be trying to get the smallest score possible, because your score
                        represents your final confined area
                    </li>
                    <li>Lastly play to have fun!</li>
